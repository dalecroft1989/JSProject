<p class="textcenter">Explore 25 wilderness paths along North America's easternmost coastline.

    The East Coast Trail unites genuine wilderness hiking with richly historic communities from Topsail Beach, to Cape
    St. Francis, to Cappahayden. There are over 336 kilometers of trail to explore.

    The paths of the East Coast Trail take you past towering cliffs and headlands, sea stacks, deep fjords, and a natural
    wave-driven geyser called the Spout. Experience abandoned settlements, lighthouses, ecological reserves, seabird
    colonies, whales, icebergs, the world's southernmost caribou herd, historic sites, a 50-metre suspension bridge, two
    active archaeological dig sites, and many more attractions.</p>
<p class="textcenter">This site will give you a little rundown on the different trails of the ECT network and let you
    pick and choose which trails you'd like to complete in a certain time and this will give you the pace at which you'd
    need to go.</p>
